# The Decentralized Manifesto of the Minecraft Java Community

## Preamble
We, the players, builders, redstoners, modders, and server admins of the Minecraft Java Edition community, stand united in our love for a game that thrives on freedom, creativity, and the unbound spirit of its players. Minecraft Java Edition is more than a game—it’s a canvas, a platform, a universe shaped by us, for us. We reject the shackles of centralized control and declare our commitment to a decentralized, player-driven future.

## Our Principles
1. **Players Above All**  
   The heart of Minecraft is its players. No authority—corporate or otherwise—should dictate how we play, build, or create. The community’s voice is the loudest, and our creations are the soul of the game.

2. **Community Development Reigns Supreme**  
   From Forge to Fabric, Spigot to Paper, our tools and frameworks empower us to reshape the game. Mods, plugins, resource packs, and data packs are the lifeblood of Java Edition, and we celebrate the coders, artists, and dreamers who make them possible.

3. **Freedom of Servers**  
   Java servers—whether massive hubs like Hypixel or cozy private worlds—are our domains. We run them, we mod them, we make the rules. No central gatekeeper can claim control over our communities.

4. **Openness for All**  
   We welcome Bedrock players to join our Java servers through tools like Geyser, breaking down barriers and uniting all Minecrafters under the banner of freedom. Centralized platforms like the Marketplace have no place in our vision.

5. **No to Official Overreach**  
   We oppose any attempt to limit modding, restrict server autonomy, or impose commercialized ecosystems. Our game thrives because of its openness, not in spite of it.

## Our Pledge
- We will **create** without limits, pushing the boundaries of what Minecraft can be through mods, maps, and mechanics.  
- We will **share** our knowledge, tools, and creations freely, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.  
- We will **defend** the decentralized spirit of Java Edition, resisting any efforts to centralize or commodify our game.  
- We will **welcome** all players—Java or Bedrock—who share our passion for a free and open Minecraft, uniting through cross-platform tools like Geyser.  
- We will **build** a future where the community, not corporations, shapes the destiny of Minecraft.

## Call to Action
To every player, modder, server admin, and dreamer:  
- Run your servers, mod your game, and create without fear.  
- Support open-source tools and community projects.
- Share your worlds, your code, your ideas—because a thriving community is a shared one.  
- Stand firm against centralized control, and let’s keep Minecraft Java Edition a beacon of player-driven creativity.

**For the love of the block, for the power of the player, for the glory of the community—Java Edition forever!**

The Minecraft Java Community*
